\chapter{Ion Trap Apparatus}

A vast effort is spent on the initial build-up of the an ion trap system, but
throughout the life of the experiment, a greater effort is spent on its daily
maintenance.  I hope that this chapter will serve as a resource for future
members of the FastGates team, as well as provide a useful recipe for anyone
building a similar system. \\

Due to the size and complexity of the system, we introduce an inital overview of
the design, motivated by the desired functions.  As the name suggests, an ion
trap experiment aims to confine arrays of single ions, this is achieved by
static and dynamic electric fields which, due to the ions possesing non-zero
electric charge, can provide trapping potentials, section~\ref{sec:The Ion
Trap}. Due to the fragility of the internal states of the ion (these are state
of the art sensors after all), we must take great care in isolating the ion from
any noisy environment. This neccesitates the use of ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
systems, section~\ref{sec:Vacuum System}, vibration isolation, and magnetic
shielding, section~\ref{sec:Magnetic Field}. To manipulate the internal electronic states of the ion, we create
local electric and magnetic fields using RF antennae and, in this work, lasers,
sections~\ref{sec:Laser systems} and~\ref{sec:Narrow Line Width 729 Laser}.
Finally, to interface with the apparatus we have built, at the time scales set by our interaction strengths, we require a sophisticated and custom control system which is discussed in section~\ref{sec:Sinara Hardware}.

\chapter{Experiment Characterisation}

Before we can dive into running novel experiments involving the motion and spin
of the atoms, we need to characterise our apparatus. This allows us to both
benchmark our system against state of the art results, and to reveal any
current limitations of the apparatus which we may need to address.

\subsection{Cooling}
\label{sec:Cooling}
    % Doppler cooling
    % Sideband cooling
    For any interaction involving the motion of the ion, we require both the
    ability to prepare the motional state with high fidelity, and to
    subsequently measure this motional state to verify correct preparation. For
    entangling gates, and the creation of squeezed states which we are
    considering in this chapter, we assume that we begin in the motional ground
    state, or in other words, Fock state zero.  Our initially trapped ions will
    be in some high temperature thermal state, (*given by the oven temperature
    and the PI laser momenta kicks*). We first doppler cool our ions, and then
    subsequently sideband cool them. We give a brief description of these two
    cooling processes here.\\
    Doppler cooling exploits the fact that incident light onto a moving ion will
    appear frequency shifted in the rest frame of the ion. For Doppler cooling
    of $^40$Ca$^+$, we apply both the 397~nm and 866~nm lasers. We initially red
    detune the 397~nm laser by around 100~MHz. This results in the preferential
    absorption of a quanta of 397~nm light by ions with a velocity vector
    antiparallel photon k-vector. After this absorption, the ion will be in the
    excited $4P_{3/2}$ state and spontaneously decay to either the $4S_{1/2}$,
    or the $3D_{3/2}$ emitting a photon of either 397~nm or of 866~nm
    respectively into a random direction. These two decay paths have a branching
    ratio of XX.  As we desire many photon kicks to cool our ions, we repump the
    electron out of this metastable $3D_{3/2}$ level by applying an on resonant
    866~nm beam.  The absorption and sequential emission of this 397~nm photon
    will lead to a net reduction in the motional energy of the ion if the photon
    is emitted at a higher energy than when absorbed. The equilibrium
    temperature is given by the condition where the doppler cooling rate is
    equal to photon recoil heating of the ion. Assuming a Lorentzian absorption
    profile, the minimum temperature is given by,
    \begin{equation}
    T_{Doppler} \approx \frac{\hbar\gamma}{2k_B}
    \end{equation}
    where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\gamma$ is the natural
    linewidth of the transition, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.\\ For
    $^{40}$Ca$^+$, the natural linewidth of the 397|nm transition is $\gamma =
    2\pi 21$~MHz, leading to a Doppler temperature of approximately 0.5~mK.
