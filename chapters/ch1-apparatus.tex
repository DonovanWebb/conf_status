    A vast effort is spent on the initial build-up of the ion trap system, but
    throughout the life of the experiment, a greater effort is spent on its daily
    maintenance.  I hope that this chapter will serve as a useful debugging-resource for future
    members of the FastGates team, and as a detailed recipe for anyone
    building a similar system. \\

    Due to the size and complexity of the system, we introduce an inital overview of
    the design, motivated by the desired functions.  
    Many such  ion trap experiment overviews exist in the theses of previous PhD generations, and so we will limit the discussion here to the unique features and capabilities of our system.\\
    
    As a map for this section we state the landmark features of an ``ion trap''
    experiment. First, to confine the ions static and dynamic electric fields
    are used which, due to ions possesing non-zero electric charge, can provide
    trapping potentials, section~\ref{sec:The Ion Trap}. Due to the fragility of
    the internal states of the ion (these are state -of-the-art sensors after
    all), we must take great care in isolating the ion from any noisy
    environment. This neccesitates the use of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) systems,
    section~\ref{sec:Vacuum System}, vibration isolation, and magnetic
    shielding, section~\ref{sec:Magnetic Field}. To manipulate the internal
    electronic states of the ion, we create local electric and magnetic fields
    using RF antennae and, in this work, lasers, sections~\ref{sec:Laser
    systems} and~\ref{sec:Narrow Line Width 729 Laser}.  Finally, to interface
    with the apparatus we have built, at the time scales set by our interaction
    strengths, we require a sophisticated and custom control system.

    From Earnshaw's theorem,
    $(\nabla^2 V = 0),$ a stable stationary point in 3D can not be realized
    using only static electric potentials, $V$, as if the potential is confining
    in two dimensions, it will be anticonfining in the third. Therefore, to
    achieve stable trapping, either an oscillating electric field (Paul
    trap~\cite{XXX}), or a static magnetic field (Penning traps~\cite{XXX}) is
    used to create 3D confining pseudopotentials.\\
    Recently, the microfabricated surface style linear Paul trap has gained
    popularity due to the maturity of chip fabrication
    technologies~\cite{allcock_surface-electrode_2011} and the potential route
    to scalability this offers~\cite{kielpinski_architecture_2002}. In the surface trap, the 3D radial and axial
    electrodes of a ``macro'' trap are effectively projected onto a 2D surface.
    The stable confining point of such a trap is typically on the order of $50-100$ $\mu$m
    above the chip surface. The ease of fabrication of surface traps has allowed
    the creation of complex multizone devices with many DC electrodes.  These
    multizone traps enable the shuttling of ions, a requirement for Quantum CCD
    type architectures~\cite{kielpinski_architecture_2002}. However, this
    surface style geometry typically come with two costs: the depth of the
    trapping potential is often greatly reduced, and the close proximity of the
    surface to the ion can be a large contributor to motional heating
    rates~\cite{turchette_heating_2000}. \\
    Our trap is provided by the \emph{National Physical Laboratory} in the UK. This is a microfabricated 3D trap, which brings together the
    advantages of chip fabrication as well as the low heating rates and high
    trapping depths of a 3D style trap with greater ion-surface distances. Details on its design and characterisations can be found in~\cite{see_fabrication_2013,
    wilpers_monolithic_2012}. Figure~\ref{fig:trap} shows the electrode geometry of the trap and the relevant length scales.
    The ion-surface distance is now of the order $250$ $\mu$m and we have
    demonstrated heating rates of $ 33(3)$~q/s on a 4~MHz radial mode (see
    section~\ref{sec:Heating}).\\

    We aim for an axial ion separation of around $5$~$\mu$m which, for
    $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ions means a trapping potential of $\omega_z \approx 2\pi
    \cdot 1.6$~MHz. This ion separation was chosen as a balance between the
    desire for high mode frequencies while keeping cross talk due to
    laser-addressing negligible.\\ The mode frequencies that can be achieved are
    ultimately limited by the breakdown voltage of the trap electrodes, $V_{\rm
    MAX} = 400$~Vpp.\\ Within this constraint, we are targeting $\sim 4$~MHz for
    our radial frequencies. The choice of this higher frequency is motivated by
    several factors: the Doppler cooling limit is reduced, and the frequency
    separation between modes can be increased, which is useful for simplifying
    interactions involving motion.\\ 
    In the following two sections we describe the experimental parameters used
    in our apparatus to achieve these mode frequencies.\\

    %Figure like Milne would be nice here - but showing zig-zag for 5 ions is hard...

    %Using the pseudopotential approximation~\cite{madsen_planar_2004} for the
    %confining field, we can find a trapping frequency in one radial direction
    %$\omega_p$
    %\begin{equation}
    %\omega_p = \frac{e\alpha V_{RF}}{\sqrt{2}\Omega_{RF}M\rho^2},
    %\label{eq:pseudopotential}
    %\end{equation}
    %where $\alpha$ is a factor of order unity given by the geometry of the trap,
    %$V_{RF}$ and $\Omega_{RF}$ are the voltage and frequency provided to the
    %RF-electrode, $M$ is the mass of the ion, and $\rho$ is the ion-RF electrode
    %separation.  Applying some DC voltage on the axial electrodes leads to axial
    %confinement with frequency $\omega_{ax}$, but must defocus the radial
    %confinements as the total curvature of the pseudopotential must remain
    %constant,
    %\begin{equation}
    %\omega_{rad} = \sqrt{\omega_p^2 - \omega_{ax}^2/2}.
    %\end{equation}
    %Due to the geometry of the DC electrodes with respect to the ion chain, the
    %\emph{NPL} trap focuses one of the radial modes and defocuses the other when
    %the DC electrodes are increased,
    %\begin{equation}
    %\omega_{rad\pm} = \sqrt{\omega_p^2 - (1\mp\beta)\omega_{ax}^2/2},
    %\end{equation}
    %where $\beta$ is some factor due to the geometry of this geometry. From
    %simulation $\beta > 1$ for $\Omega_{RF} = 2\pi\cdot 23$~MHz and $V_{RF} =
    %200$~V and so one radial mode increases with DC voltage applied and one
    %decreases.

    %\begin{tabular}{ c|c c c c c }
    %& $V_{RF}$/V &  $V_{DC}$/V &$\Omega_{RF}$/($2\pi\cdot$MHz)& $\omega$/($2\pi\cdot$MHz)   & q \\

    %A possible set of parameters to achieve $\omega_{ax} = 2\pi \cdot 1.6$~MHz
    %and $\omega_{rad+} = 2\pi \cdot 4.9$~MHz can be seen in the ``Experiment''
    %trapping in Table~\ref{table:freqs}.

    %From the Mathieu equations, the areas of stability depend upon a factor
    %$q$~\cite{berkeland_minimization_1998}, where
    %$q=2\sqrt(2)\omega/\Omega_{RF}$.  Generally, we require $q$ to be as low
    %($q<0.3$) for convenient trapping.  To satisfy this requirement a
    %``Loading'' setting (with parameters in table~\ref{table:freqs}) may be used
    %with $q = 0.25$ and then the $V_{RF}$ ramped to the ``Experiment'' trapping
    %for high radial mode frequencies.

\subsection{Trap RF Chain}

    % Maybe a figure describing the elements within the RF chain

        % Resonator

% Pre reqs:
    % NPL trap geometry
    To utilise radial motional modes for low error quantum gates, we require the
    radio frequency (RF) field that produces the desired trapping
    pseudopotential to be both frequency and amplitude stable. Our \emph{NPL}
    trap is rated for a max peak-to-peak voltage of 400~Vpp on the RF
    electrodes. Here we describe the elements of the ``RF chain'' that supplies
    this voltage. \\
    Our frequency source is a DDS-based synthesiser, named \emph{Urukul}, part
    of the \emph{Artiq Sinara}~\cite{XXX} hardware ecosystem. We operate the
    \emph{Urukul} at max output power, +10~dBm and with a frequency around $27.8$~MHz. This
    signal is then fed to an ``ultra-low noise limiting amplifier" named
    \emph{Squareatron}~\cite{XXX}. The purpose of \emph{Squareatron} is to
    greatly reduce the amplitude noise of the RF signal, $V_{\rm RF}$, which is
    key to low radial mode frequency drifts due to the linear
    relationship between radial trapping frequency and $V_{\rm RF}$. The \emph{Squareatron} outputs +17.4~dBm,
    which we subsequently attenuate by 19.5~dB. We then amplify the signal by a
    further 33.7~dB using a \emph{Mini-Circuits ZHL-1-2W-S+}, high power
    amplifier. We now have +32 dBm RF power to drive the trap
    electrodes, however we need to match the current 50~$\Omega$ impedance to
    the small capacitance of the trap electrodes. To do this, we use an LC
    impedance matching circuit with tuned resonant frequency of 27.84~MHz, and a
    measured Q factor of 43.8 (found by fitting S11 impedance measurements).
    This resonant circuit has three main effects: it ensures good power transfer
    between RF input and trap electrodes via impedance matching, it steps up the
    voltage to the required 400~Vpp, and it filters out RF noise and unwated harmonics due to
    the narrow bandpass nature of the LC circuit. \\
    If components are chosen correctly, and adequately protected from
    environmental noise, this chain can produce the desired frequency and
    amplitude stable RF we require. Characterisations of the motional mode
    stability are discussed in section~\ref{sec:Motional Mode Stability}. We are
    still yet to fully quantify and debug the motional stability against thermal
    and mechanical noise, however it should be noted that other groups do opt
    for active stabilisation of RF amplitude through closed feedback loops~\cite{XXX}.\\

    Voltage is supplied to the DC electrodes using \emph{Fastino}, a
    multi-channel DAC part of the \emph{Artiq Sinara} hardware
    ecosystem~\cite{}.\\
    The ion is confined in the ``operation" zone, seen in
    figure~\ref{fig:trap}c. The axial trapping is provided by electrodes
    DC-b5 and DC-f5, where b and f correspond to the back and front plane of the trap. 
    The DAC provides $\sim 10$~V to these electrodes to produce an axial frequency of 1.6~MHz.
    
\section{Magnetic Field}
\label{sec:Magnetic Field}
% Main points:
    % Permanent magnets
    % MUMetal box
    Stable Zeeman shifts of the ion energy levels are required for long spin
    coherence times (see section~\ref{sec:Coherence}), and for low error single-
    and two-qubit gates. We use a permanent magnet array of Samarium Cobalt,
    Sm$_2$Co$_17$, in a Helmholtz configuration to create a stable magnetic
    field of 5.4~G. Samarium Cobalt was chosen for its low temperature
    coefficient of remenance, -0.03\%/K.\\
    The ion is shielded from unwanted external magnetic fields by two layers of
    3~mm thick MuMetal shielding from \emph{MagneticShields}. The factory quoted
    shielding factor is 546 for DC fields. Spin coherence time comparisons for
    the ion with and without magnetic shielding are shown in
    section~\ref{sec:Coherence}.\\

    Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) is required to extend the ion storage lifetime.
    However, UHV equipment is often bulky, and puts constraints on the access
    and visibility of the ion chain. Here we describe the designed vacuum
    system, and beam access.  The vacuum system and beam geometries were
    designed by Sebastian Saner and Mariella Minder, and constructed by
    Sebastian Saner, Fabian Pokorny, and myself.\\
    
    We aim for a residual pressure of $<10^{-11}$ mbar. For this strict
    requirement, we must take care in selecting in-vacuum materials, and follow
    thorough cleaning and baking procedures. A summary of tactics that were
    useful in the construction of the vacuum system can be found
    in~\cite{birnbaum_ultra-high_2005, wolf_cryogenic_2019}.\\
    A schematic and photograph of the vacuum system can be seen in
    Figure~\ref{fig:can}. The system consists of a 6" spherical-octagonal
    experimental chamber\footnote{Kimball MCF600-SphOct-F2C8} connected to a
    spherical chamber with ion pump\footnote{Agilent VacIon Plus 20 Pump}, ion
    gauge\footnote{Agilent UHV-24P Ion gauge} and Titanium sublimator pump
    (TSP)\footnote{Scanwel custom housing} attached. The ion pump and TSP
    maintain the UHV to the desired $<10^{-11}$~mbar. We find that on the ion
    pump alone we cannot maintain UHV indefinitely, however, firing the TSP
    every 4 weeks with 41~A for 60 seconds provides a sufficient pumping rate.
    At the time of system baking, we performed a He leak test, but did not find
    any external leaks. We suspect the gradual pressure increase is either due
    to our use of in-vacuum optics, optics epoxy adhesive\footnote{EPO-TEK
    353ND}, or our use of soldered PCB components.\\
    For optical access we have two recessed CF100 viewports\footnote{UK Atomic
    Energy Authority P/N VPR100015} on the two large faces of the experiment
    can. We require recessed viewports due to our chosen main
    objectives\footnote{Photon Gear custom Atom Imager}. These custom objectives
    have an effective focal length of 33~mm, a working distance of 24.4~mm, and
    a numerical aperture of 0.6. They are coated for 397-nm and 729-nm.
    The consideration for dual high NA objectives is relatively unique in ion trap experiments, and was mainly motivated by previous work on fast entangling gates via standing waves~\cite{saner_breaking_2023}. \\
    There is further optical access via
    two CF40 side viewports\footnote{LewVac ZFSVP-DUV-40CF-OUM} coated
    for 397-nm, 422-nm, 729-nm, 854-nm and 866-nm.  Due to the spatial
    constraints from the trap assembly and high NA objectives, we require
    multiple of our beam to enter the vacuum can through these side ports. For the ion chain to be visible from these side ports we use in vacuum dielectric
    mirrors. These fused-silica mirrors are UHV rated and coated for 372-nm, 397-nm,
    422-nm, 729-nm, 854-nm and 866-nm, with reflectivities of >99\% for both s-
    and p-polarised light. Figure~\ref{fig:can} shows a schematic of the beam
    geometries via the side ports. A limitation of this beam geometry is that due to the permanent B-field direction, we are unable to apply pure $\pi$ or $\sigma_{\pm}$ light to the ion. However for applications where strict polarisation control is needed, the beams can be incident through the CF100 viewport.\\
    We use an electrical feedthrough on a CF40 flange\footnote{Allectra custom}
    to supply our trap chip and atomic source oven with DC and RF voltages. As
    the DC cables run within close proximity to the RF supply, electrical pick
    up is a potential issue for our DC lines. RF leaked onto our DC electrodes
    will create unwanted pseudopotential which can lead to unexpected mode
    geometries, or required compensation field. We mitigate this leakage through
    an in-vacuum RC low pass filter board within close proximity of the trap
    chip with a cutoff frequency of 17~kHz. The trap chip is mounted onto this
    filter board via a custom Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) interposer with
    electric feedthroughs via embedded \emph{Fuzz buttons}\footnote{Custom
    Interconnects}. \\

        729-nm. XXX TODO: Add zeeman levels for D5/2.
        }

    \label{fig:ion}
    \end{figure}

    Singly-charged group 2 elements are popular in ion trap
    experiments due to their single outer electron resulting in Hydrogen-like
    energy levels. In this thesis we use \ca.\\
    \ca has
    no nuclear spin giving the
    (relatively) simple level structure shown in figure~\ref{fig:ion}. The external
    magnetic field of $5.4$~G is applied to split the levels via the Zeeman
    effect. The relevant laser transitions for our planned ion trap
    experiment are indicated.\\
    A zero nuclear spin isotope of calcium was chosen due to this simple level
    structure without hyperfine splitting. The greater number of levels due to
    hyperfine splitting lead to more decay paths and therefore greater
    complications in both cooling and gate schemes. However, this does come at
    the cost of no available magnetic field insensitive transitions, which are
    often used in ion trap experiments to further decouple the ion from a noisy
    environment~\cite{}. \\
    We define our qubit by the quadrupole transition at 729-nm, which we describe in the following section.\\
    Access to other excited levels, outside of our defined two level system, are crucial for ion trap quantum logic so that we can readout the qubit with state selective fluorescence (397-nm, and 866-nm transitions) and optically pump for state preparation (397-nm, 866-nm, and 854-nm transitions). Details on these schemes are given in chapter~\ref{ch:Characterisation}. We also require access to two additional transitions in neutral calcium for isotope selective ionisation, 422-nm and 372-nm.\\
    These transitions (apart from the 729-nm) are all driven by diode lasers\footnote{All Toptica diodes. Red lasers: MDL DL pro; Blue lasers: MDL DL pro HP; 372-nm: iBEAM-SMART-375-S}, which are frequency stabilised to a reference cavity\footnote{Stable Laser Systems SLS-6010 4-Bore Cylindrical Cavity} via Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking. We require PDH locking to ensure that laser frequencies are stable to <1~MHz level, well below the natural line widths of all the dipole transitions listed above. We continuosly monitor the laser frequencies with a wavemeter\footnote{HighFinesse WS7}.\\
    Frequency and amplitude control for all lasers is achieved via acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) which are driven by Artiq integrated DDS chips, \emph{Urukuls}. We use AOMs in a double pass configuration to allow shifts of the laser frequency by $\pm \sim 100$~MHz, with no signicant angular shifts or loss of fibre coupling.

    Lasers are a key tool for creating the highly localised, strong electric
    field amplitudes and gradients needed to drive both carrier and sideband
    transitions of the trapped ion.\\ As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ion}, we will
    use two levels within the 4S\textsubscript{1/2} to 3D\textsubscript{5/2}
    manifolds to define our qubit. This is an electric quadrupole transition as
    $\Delta l = 2$.  For the Calcium ion this transition is at 729-nm, and so we
    use a near resonance 729-nm laser to implement single- and multi-qubit gates
    (sections~\ref{sec:Randomised Benchmarking} and~\ref{sec:Two-Qubit
    Entangling Gates}). We also use this transition, after Doppler cooling, for
    resolved sideband cooling to bring the motional mode close to its ground
    state (as discussed in section~\ref{sec:Cooling}).

    This transition is narrrow line width due the the long lived
    3D\textsubscript{5/2} state, and so, for power efficiency, we must use a
    narrow linewidth laser. For our ``fast entangling gates'' use case we
    require large electric-field intensities at the ion to drive sideband
    transitions, this will be discussed further in the single-addressing and
    two-qubit gate sections, but here it is sufficient to say we require >100 mW
    of light at the ion plane.  Here we describe the built system 
    consisting of a Ti:Sapph laser system pumped with by an Nd:YAG 532-nm laser.\\

    We pump an \emph{M2 Solstis} Ti:Sapph~\cite{XXX} with 18 W of 532-nm light
    from a \emph{Coherent Verdi-V} system~\cite{XXX} to produce around 5W of
    729-nm light.  The Ti:Sapph is engineered to operate with a stable $<50$~kHz
    linewidth. Ti:Sapph crystals have broadband gain profiles~\cite{XXX}, which
    is often exploited in research environments to create frequency tunable
    laser systems. We however want a narrow linewidth, single frequency laser,
    and so the \emph{Solstis} has multiple intracavity frequency selective
    elements. These consist of (in order of coarse frequency selectivity), a
    birefringent filter, a tunable Fabry-P\'erot etalon, and the surrounding
    bow-tie cavity. For stable single mode operation, the \emph{Solstis} employs
    an active ``dither" servo to lock the peak of etalon transmission to one of
    the cavity longitudinal mode. This dither consists of periodically varying
    the etalon spacing with a frequency of around 20~kHz. We must be aware of
    this dither frequency as the phase modulation leads to the creation of
    sidebands on our light which can interact with the ion causing unexpected
    errors in gates. We can observe this dither frequency (and harmonics of it)
    with our ion via composite pulse experiments, however it is currently not
    expected to be a limiting source of error in any of our desired interactions
    we study.\\

    As mentioned, the \emph{Solstis} alone can operate with linewidths of
    $<50kHz$, however we push this further by referencing the Ti:Sapph output
    with an ulta high finesse cavity by \emph{Stable Laser Systems} and applying
    a Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) lock~\cite{}.  A schematic of our 729-nm system is
    shown in Figure~\ref{fig:729}.  PDH locking requires applying two sidebands
    via an electro-optical modulator (EOM) to the light and directing it onto
    the stable cavity. The light reflected from the cavity is then directed onto
    a fast photodetector (\emph{Thorlabs PDA10A2}). The reflection from the
    cavity consists of the interference between the carrier and the sidebands
    which have been respectively altered by the cavity transfer function. The
    photodetector signal is mixed down with the same oscillator signal as
    provided to the EOM but delayed by some chosen phase, and finally low pass
    filtered to produce a signal for use as the error signal in the servo loop.
    This error gives a measure for how far the carrier frequency is from the
    stable cavity resonant frequency and is used for feedback onto the control
    AOM situated after the Solstis. The electronics for this control loop are
    provided also by Stable Laser Systems in the form of their \emph{FPGA Servo}
    lock box. For an effective PDH lock, we require both short and long term
    stability of our reference cavity. To ensure the cavity is insensitive to
    the environment, it is made of an ultra low expansion material. We
    temperature stabilise the cavity at the zero crossing temperature of
    $30.6^\circ$C, and it is further isolated by being stored in a vacuum system
    at $<1e-7$~mbar. We measure a long term cavity drift of 309(1) Hz/hr over
    125 days, seen in figure~\ref{fig:729}. This measurement uses the ion as a
    frequency reference to probe the cavity frequency and is discussed in
    section~\ref{sec:Laser Offset}.\\
    Figure~\ref{fig:729} displays the other beam paths for our 729-nm system.
    Some light is picked off and sent to a wavemeter to continuosly monitor the
    frequency. However, the majority is coupled to two output fibres for our
    experiment and another within the group. We transport the 729-nm light from
    a dedicated laser lab to a room containing the trap apparatus by a 10~m
    single mode polarization maintaining fibre.  The fibre is
    beneficial in cleaning up the mode from the Ti:Sapph, however it can
    introduce phase noise due to mechanical and thermal effects along the 10~m
    length. To remove this introduced noise we utilise passive stabilisation in
    the form of thick foam tubing along the fibre length as well as active
    stabilisation by popular fibre-noise-cancellation technique~\cite{XXX}. This
    topic has been discussed extensively in multiple PhD and Masters
    theses~\cite{XXX}, and so here we only quote the relevant control aspects of
    our arrangement. We use the \emph{Sinara Stabilizer}~\cite{XXX} board, a
    dual channel PID microcontroller, with the \emph{Pounder}~\cite{XXX}
    mezzanine board, a dual channel PDH lock generator. The FNC PID software was
    developed by Ayush Agrawal ~\cite{XXX}. A comparison of spin coherence times
    is shown in section~\ref{sec:Coherence} with and without fibre noise
    cancellation enabled. \\


\subsection{Single Addressing System}
\label{sec:Single Addressing System}
% This section is not used in any characterisation - could be left for outlook!
% Main points:
    % The advantages of single addressing using AODs
        % Ion selectivity
        % High intensity electric field
    % single addressing system creating standing waves
    % render of single addressing system
% Pre reqs:
    % 729 system
    % High NA
    % Trap package
    % Motivation for future experiments
    A unique feature of our system is the ability to produce standing wave
    single ion addressing. The design of this system is shown in
    figure~\ref{fig:AOD}.  A single ion addressing system must be able to
    illuminate selected ions in the crystal whilst the others remain
    unperturbed. The advantage of single addressing, other than ion selectivity,
    is the increased intensity of light due to the tight waist at the ion
    location. \\
    Our ions will be separated by a distance $d\approx 5~\mu$m.  Focussing a
    collimated 729-nm beam with an objective lens of NA = 0.6 onto the ion
    provides $\omega_0 = 386$~nm.  Abberations present in real optical
    components will cause the addressed spot to be increasingly non-gaussian and
    lead to unfavourable cross talk at the neighbouring ions. Therefore care is
    taken in the optical design.\\
    To produce more than one addressed spot and to steer the spots along the ion
    crystal, we use Acousto-Optical-Deflectors\footnote{ISOMET OAD1343-XY-T70S}
    (AODs)~\cite{nagourney_quantum_2014, li_low-crosstalk_2023,
    pogorelov_compact_2021}. The beam deflection angle is proportional to the
    drive frequency supplied to the AOD. \\
