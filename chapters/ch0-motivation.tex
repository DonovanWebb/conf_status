% Main points:
    % High overview of work.
    % List of unique requirements for the system
        % Motional control
        % Single addressing
        % Standing waves
    % Building a system with spin and motion control.
    % Here characterisation
    % But we want to use this experiment for...
    % E.g. Feynman diagram simulation
