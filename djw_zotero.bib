	abstract = {A scheme for fast 3-D laser scanning using acousto-optic deflectors is proposed and demonstrated. By employing counterpropagating acoustic waves that are both chirped and offset in their frequencies, we show that it is possible to simultaneously scan both axially and laterally with frame rates on the order of tens of kilohertz. This scheme was specifically designed for application with multiphoton imaging, particularly of neurons, where it will enable the concurrent monitoring of physiological signals at multiple locations within a microscopic 3-D volume (350×350×200 µm). When used for this purpose, we demonstrate how this scheme would also inherently compensate for spatial dispersion when ultrafast laser pulses are used in acousto-optic multiphoton microscopy.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00340-018-7011-0},
	abstract = {We present an experimental technique to determine the degenerate two-photon absorption (2PA) spectra by performing a single Z-scan using a high-spectral-irradiance white light continuum (WLC) generated by a hollow core fiber. The hollow fiber was filled with Argon (Ar) gas at a pressure of 0.6 bar and was pumped with 500 mJ, 30 fs, and 800 nm pulses. The broadband WLC pulses with 350 nm bandwidth in the range of 600–950 nm were compressed to sub-8 fs pulses. To characterize and interpret the data obtained from this method, the spectral, temporal and spatial characteristics of the WLC were first analyzed. The WLC emerging from the compressor was dispersed using a prism pair and then focused into the sample by a cylindrical lens. Since different spectral components are spatially separated, any part of the sample in the beam cross section is irradiated with almost single wavelength pulses leading to only a degenerate 2PA process. The nonlinear transmittance was then measured by a charge-coupled-device (CCD) line camera as a function of the sample position while the sample was moved along the beam direction by a motorized translation stage. In this way the Z-scans at different wavelengths in the WLC spectral range can be measured and thus the wavelength-resolved degenerate 2PA spectra can be obtained by performing a single scan using dispersive WLC. This method was verified on a well-characterized dye Rhodamine B and yield a reasonable agreement with the data found in the literature. We used this method to determine the 2PA spectra of some two-photon initiators (2PIs) developed for two-photon polymerization (2PP) based 3D micro-structuring.},

In this paper, a new method of modelling the laser–ion interaction is introduced that turns out to be superior to standard techniques for the description of gate operations on optical qubits. The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on σz ⊗ σz and σφ ⊗ σφ interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser ﬁeld can be realized by an amplitudemodulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.},

	abstract = {Universal control of multiple qubits—the ability to entangle qubits and to perform arbitrary individual qubit operations1—is a fundamental resource for quantum computing2, simulation3 and networking4. Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations5–7 and single-qubit rotations8 so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams9–12 or by moving ions with respect to laser beams13–15, but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods16–20 may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of \$\$\{1\}\_\{-0.0017\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0\}\$\$and \$\$\{0.9977\}\_\{-0.0013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0010\}\$\$, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics21,22 and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout23,24 provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.},

	abstract = {We present a theoretical study of nondipole excitation of a single trapped atom by twisted light. Special emphasis is placed on effects that arise from the interplay between internal (electronic) and vibrational (center-of-mass) degrees of freedom of an atom. In order to provide a fully quantum mechanical understanding of the excitation, we used the density-matrix approach based on the Liouville–von Neumann equation. The developed theory has been applied to the particular case of the 4s2S1/2→3d2D5/2 electric quadrupole (E2) transition in a 40Ca+ ion induced by Laguerre-Gaussian modes. It was found that the Rabi oscillations can show unconventional anharmonic behavior that is attributed to the strong coupling between vibrational levels of the trap. This effect is accompanied by the transfer of angular momentum to the center-of-mass motion and becomes most pronounced when the Rabi frequency is comparable to the trapping frequency.},

In prior work, we explored the key concepts relating to deconstructing an object into its irreducible parts and then evaluating the minimum number of steps required to rebuild it, allowing for the reuse of constructed sub-objects. We have also explored the application of this approach to molecules, as molecular assembly, and how molecular assembly can be inferred experimentally and used for life detection. In this article, we formalise the core assembly concepts mathematically in terms of assembly spaces and related concepts and determine bounds on the assembly index. We explore examples of constructing assembly spaces for mathematical and physical objects and propose that objects with a high assembly index can be uniquely identified as those that must have been produced using directed biological or technological processes rather than purely random processes, thereby defining a new scale of aliveness. We think this approach is needed to help identify the new physical and chemical laws needed to understand what life is, by quantifying what life does.},

The lattice is generated by off-resonant free-space laser beams, and we actively stabilize its phase by measuring its ac-Stark shift on a trapped ion. The ion is localized within the standing wave to better than 2\% of its period. The locked lattice allows us to apply displacement operations via resonant optical forces with a controlled direction in phase space. Moreover, we observe the lattice-induced phase evolution of spin superposition states in order to analyze the relevant decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we employ lattice-induced phase shifts for inferring the variation of the ion position over the 157 μm range along the trap axis at accuracies of better than 6 nm.},

We show that stick-slip friction can be tuned from maximal to nearly frictionless via arrangement of the ions relative to the substrate. By varying the ion number, we also show that this strong dependence of friction on the structural mismatch, as predicted by many-particle models, already emerges at the level of two or three atoms. This model system enables a microscopic and systematic investigation of friction, potentially even into the quantum many-body regime.},

Displacing the ion along the standing wave, we show a periodic suppression of the carrier and sideband transitions with the cycles for the two cases 180∘ out of phase with each other. This technique allows for the suppression of off-resonant carrier excitations when addressing the motional sidebands, and has applications in quantum simulation and quantum control. Using the standing-wave fringes, we measure the relative ion height as a function of applied electric field, allowing for a precise measurement of ion displacement and, combined with measured micromotion amplitudes, a validation of trap numerical models.},

These advances result from the successful work of generations of scientists who have made use of quantum physics, spending only a small fraction of their time puzzling at its wonders and directing their efforts to apply it at explaining Nature. It then considers the elaboration of the theory, the long process during which the strange and counter-intuitive manifestations of the quantum have emerged. It is during this process — mainly in the 1920s — that thought experiments were conceived. The chapter recalls their main features and describes, on a few examples, how they are now realized in the laboratory by exploiting modern technology. These experiments can be quite generally viewed as manipulations of quantum oscillators and two-level spin-like particles in mutual interaction. An overview of the subsequent chapters is presented.},

The Hem-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, Hem cannot generate any forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that Hem attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and to the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by Hint.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) networks are studied by a combination of numerical and approximate analytical treatments. The probability of failure of the recovery I operation is calculated for a variety of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and more noise tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries that can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various parameters. The main parameters are the gate gamma and memory epsilon failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t(m) required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on the [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise gamma(0) is a function of epsilon/gamma and t(m); example values are \{epsilon/gamma,t(m), gamma(0)\} = \{1,1,10(-3)\}, \{0.01,1,3 x 10(-3)\}, \{1,100,10(-4)\}, \{0.01,100,2 x 10(-3)\}, assuming zero cost for. information transport. This represents an order of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise, compared with previous calculations, which is made possible by recent insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process.},

We present a general framework, based on the spherical tensor decomposition of the interaction Hamiltonian, for computing atomic transition matrix elements for light fields of arbitrary spatial mode and polarization structures. We study both the bare electronic matrix elements, corresponding to transitions with no coupling to the atomic center-of-mass motion, as well as the matrix elements describing the coupling to the quantized atomic motion in the resolved side-band regime. We calculate the spatial dependence of electronic and motional matrix elements for tightly focused Hermite–Gaussian, Laguerre–Gaussian and for radially and azimuthally polarized beams. We show that near the diffraction limit, all these beams exhibit longitudinal fields and field gradients, which strongly affect the selection rules and could be used to tailor the light-matter interaction. The presented framework is useful for describing trapped atoms or ions in spatially-structured light fields and therefore for designing new protocols and setups in quantum optics, -sensing and -information processing. We provide open code to reproduce our results or to evaluate interaction matrix elements for different transition types, beam structures and interaction geometries.},

While this is straightforward in the case of pure states, it is much more subtle for the more general case of mixed quantum states often found in practice. A large number of different proposals exist. In this review, we summarize the required properties of a quantum fidelity measure, and compare them, to determine which properties each of the different measures has. We show that there are large classes of measures that satisfy all the required properties of a fidelity measure, just as there are many norms of Hilbert space operators, and many measures of entropy. We compare these fidelities, with detailed proofs of their properties. We also summarize briefly the applications of these measures in teleportation, quantum memories and quantum computers, quantum communications, and quantum phase-space simulations.},

The dressed states are derived for a two-state system, a three-state system and the Bixon–Jortner model. Dissipative systems are treated using Fano theory. Related techniques, suited to the Heisenberg picture, involve dressed operators. Two examples of physical interest are discussed: an imperfect cavity, and the Jaynes–Cummings model.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed scheme for the analog quantum simulation of Z2 gauge theories in crystals of trapped ions, which exploits a more efficient hybrid encoding of the gauge and matter fields using the native internal and motional degrees of freedom. We introduce a versatile toolbox based on parametric excitations corresponding to different spin-motion-coupling schemes that induce a tunneling of the ions vibrational excitations conditioned to their internal qubit state. This building block, when implemented with a single trapped ion, corresponds to a minimal Z2 gauge theory, where the qubit plays the role of the gauge field on a synthetic link, and the vibrational excitations along different trap axes mimic the dynamical matter fields two synthetic sites, each carrying a Z2 charge. To evaluate their feasibility, we perform numerical simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to generalise this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number of ions, moving from a single link to a Z2 plaquette, and to an entire Z2 chain. We present analytical expressions for the gauge-invariant dynamics and the corresponding confinement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state simulations.},

              Quantum mechanically, an object can be described by a pair of noncommuting observables, typically by its position and momentum. The precision to which these observables can be measured is limited by unavoidable quantum fluctuations. However, the method of “squeezing” allows the fluctuations to be manipulated, while preserving the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. This allows improved measurement precision for one observable at the expense of increased fluctuations in the other. Burd
              et al.
              now show that an additional displacement of a trapped atom results in amplification of the squeezing and a further improvement in the precision with which the displacement can be determined (see the Perspective by Schleier-Smith). This technique should be useful for a number of applications in metrology.

            Detection of the weakest forces in nature is aided by increasingly sensitive measurements of the motion of mechanical oscillators. However, the attainable knowledge of an oscillator’s motion is limited by quantum fluctuations that exist even if the oscillator is in its lowest possible energy state. We demonstrate a technique for amplifying coherent displacements of a mechanical oscillator with initial magnitudes well below these zero-point fluctuations. When applying two orthogonal squeezing interactions, one before and one after a small displacement, the displacement is amplified, ideally with no added quantum noise. We implemented this protocol with a trapped-ion mechanical oscillator and determined an increase by a factor of up to 7.3 (±0.3) in sensitivity to small displacements.},

We exemplify this in a setting where there are operators satisfying [A, Aå] = 1, but the A's are not necessarily the Fock space a's; the multiboson system. It has been previously observed that the ground state of a system often can be shown to to be a coherent state. We demonstrate why this must be so.

We propose a novel shape decomposition method called Minimum Near-Convex Decomposition (MNCD), which decomposes 2D and 3D arbitrary shapes into minimum number of “near-convex” parts. With the degree of near-convexity a user speciﬁed parameter, our decomposition is robust to large local distortions and shape deformation. The shape decomposition is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem by minimizing the number of non-intersection cuts. Two major perception rules are also imposed into our scheme to improve the visual naturalness of the decomposition. The global optimal solution of this challenging discrete optimization problem is obtained by a dynamic subgradient-based branch-andbound search. Both theoretical analysis and experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-theart results without introducing redundant parts. Finally we also show the superiority of our method in the application of hand gesture recognition.},

These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

	abstract = {All laser-driven entangling operations for trapped-ion qubits have hitherto been performed without control of the optical phase of the light field, which precludes independent tuning of the carrier and motional coupling. By placing 88Sr+ ions in a λ=674 nm standing wave, whose relative position is controlled to ≈λ/100, we suppress the carrier coupling by a factor of 18, while coherently enhancing the spin-motion coupling. We experimentally demonstrate that the off-resonant carrier coupling imposes a speed limit for conventional traveling-wave Mølmer-Sørensen gates; we use the standing wave to surpass this limit and achieve a gate duration of 15 μs, restricted by the available laser power.},

	abstract = {Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction2,3,4,5,6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected “logical” qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2,3,4, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10,11,12,13,14,15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward large-scale logical processors.},

	abstract = {The prevalent approach to executing quantum algorithms on quantum computers is to break down the algorithms to a concatenation of universal gates, typically single and two-qubit gates. However such a decomposition results in long gate sequences which are exponential in the qubit register size. Furthermore, gate fidelities tend to decrease when acting in larger qubit registers. Thus high-fidelity implementations in large qubit registers are still a prominent challenge. Here we propose and investigate multiqubit entangling gates for trapped ions. Our gates couple many qubits at once, allowing us to decrease the total number of gates used while retaining a high gate fidelity. Our method employs all of the normal modes of motion of the ion chain, which allows us to operate outside of the adiabatic regime and at rates comparable to the secular ion-trapping frequency. Furthermore we extend our method for generating Hamiltonians which are suitable for quantum analog simulations, such as a nearest-neighbor spin Hamiltonian or the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian.},

In particular, in order to avoid infinite terms from the coupling to carrier transition, we focus on the phase-insensitive gate scheme here. We carefully study the effect of large excitation of motional mode beyond the limit of Lamb–Dicke approximation by including up to second order terms of the Lamb–Dicke parameter. We study the speed limit of multi-qubit global entangling gates without individual addressing requirements. Furthermore, our gates can be made insensitive to the fluctuation of initial motional phases which are difficult to stabilise in the phase-insensitive gate scheme.},

Combining the two readout results provides full information about the symmetric characteristic function. We characterize the performance of the technique by applying it to a range of archetypal quantum oscillator states, including displaced and squeezed Gaussian states as well as two and three component superpositions of displaced squeezed states which have applications in continuous variable quantum computing. For each, we discuss relevant features of the characteristic function and Wigner phase-space quasi-probability distribution.

	abstract = {Trapped-ion qubits promise certain fundamental advantages for quantum information processing (QIP), owing to their indistinguishability and relatively high isolation from noisy environments. Though these qualities have allowed demonstrations of the necessary primitives for quantum computation, the complexity of the optical apparatus required is a major impediment to implementation at scales where quantum systems offer a clear advantage over classical computers. Here, we build on previous work with trap-integrated waveguide optics, describing designs and simulations for commercial foundry-fabricated ion trap chips with integrated Si3N4 waveguides and grating couplers to implement multi-qubit operations. We detail a design intended to address and implement quantum logic gates between 5 ions in a single register, and a configuration which utilizes the stable on-chip path lengths of waveguide devices to enact a novel fast entangling two-qubit gate. The devices and approaches presented here could form elements of a scalable architecture for trapped-ion QIP.},

By ﬁltering out light on the cooling transition and detecting only the ﬂuorescence from the 2P3/2 → 2S1/2 decays, we suppress the scattered laser light background count rate to 1 s−1 while maintaining a signal of 29000 s−1 with moderate saturation of the cooling transition.

As atomic transition frequencies depend on the amplitude of this field, many experiments require a stable absolute field. Most setups use electromagnets, which require a power supply stability not usually met by commercially available units. We demonstrate stabilization of a field of 14.6 mT to 4.3 nT rms noise (0.29 ppm), compared to noise of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 100 nT without any stabilization. The rms noise is measured using a field-dependent hyperfine transition in a single \${\textasciicircum}\{43\}\$Ca\${\textasciicircum}+\$ ion held in a Paul trap at the centre of the magnetic field coils. For the \${\textasciicircum}\{43\}\$Ca\${\textasciicircum}+\$ "atomic clock" qubit transition at 14.6 mT, which depends on the field only in second order, this would yield a projected coherence time of many hours. Our system consists of a feedback loop and a feedforward circuit that control the current through the field coils and could easily be adapted to other field amplitudes, making it suitable for other applications such as neutral atom traps.},

This theory is then used to determine the dynamical behavior of laser stabilization systems. Since the theory can be used for any control system, there is also a brief discussion of other servo systems often found in the atomic physics laboratory, such as temperature-stabilization systems.},

	abstract = {The laser gain equation is derived in two ways. First, the optical Bloch equations are derived, based upon a semiclassical treatment of a two-level atomic system and a radiation field. As a visualization aid, there follows a discussion of the formally identical classical Bloch equations, which describe the behavior of a magnetic moment in a combined static and rotating magnetic field. It is shown that laser gain is proportional to the imaginary part of the linear susceptibility, which is obtained from the semiclassical treatment. The second viewpoint uses a slightly modified form of Einstein’s A and B coefficients adapted to describing interactions between atoms and monochromatic fields. Various damping and broadening mechanisms are introduced in a reasonable but non-rigorous fashion, and the crucial distinction between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening is introduced.},

The use of a cavity in transmission is briefly discussed, and the principles are first illustrated with a simple “quick and dirty” approach for generating a discriminant using a length-modulated cavity and phase-sensitive detection. The chapter concludes with a derivation of the frequency response of the discriminator to a frequency-modulated laser beam – results which are important when analyzing the servomechanism aspects of a laser which is frequency-locked to a cavity.},

For atomic resonances, the allied techniques of polarization spectroscopy and dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) are also discussed.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This work describes the design and implementation of a new apparatus to achieve quantum information processing in trapped ions using microwave methods. The apparatus involves many design improvements over a previous quantum processing experiment which achieved the highest single-qubit gate fidelity, longest coherence time, and highest microwave based two-qubit fidelity. The goal of this new experiment is a two-qubit gate speed and a fidelity improvement of a factor of 10, making microwave based gates much more feasible as quantum processors. To this end, a novel clock qubit within $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ is chosen, and the ion height is nearly halved. An anticipated heating rate increase is counteracted by the use of cryogenics. A novel ion chip design is implemented via wafer-scale fabrication and subsequently attached using a novel eutectic bonding technique. The implementation required many design and fabrication problems to be solved; these are described. The vacuum system reaches {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−11}}$ mbar even at room temperature, lowering experimental difficulty and allowing for performance comparisons at a wide temperature range. A new experiment control system, ARTIQ, and corresponding Sinara hardware is used for control. Experimental results achieved so far include a study of contributing factors to the ion loading rate, and a comparison between the designed and measured microwave fields. All results achieved to date are compatible with the main speed and fidelity goal, which should be achieved in the near future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The ac electric field that causes the micromotion may also induce significant Stark shifts in atomic transitions. We describe three methods of detecting micromotion. The first relies on the change of the average ion position as the trap potentials are changed. The second monitors the amplitude of the sidebands of a narrow atomic transition, caused by the first-order Doppler shift due to the micromotion. The last technique detects the Doppler shift induced modulation of the fluorescence rate of a broad atomic transition. We discuss the detection sensitivity of each method to Doppler and Stark shifts, and show experimental results using the last technique.},

This thesis reports experimental progress in both of these areas. In the early part of the thesis we describe the fabrication of a surface-electrode ion trap, the development of the apparatus and techniques required to operate it and the successful trapping of $^{\textrm{40}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ ions. Notably we developed methods to control the orientation of the principal axes and to minimise ion micromotion.

We explore this scaling route by testing a series of three traps that were microfabricated at Sandia National Laboratories. Investigations of micromotion and charging of the surface by laser beams were carried out and improvements to future traps are suggested. Using one of these traps we also investigated anomalous electrical noise from the electrode surfaces and discovered that it can be reduced by cleaning with a pulsed laser.

We make a design study of how best to integrate an ion trap with the microwave conductors required to implement the gate and propose a novel integrated resonant structure. The trap was fabricated and ions were successfully loaded. Single-qubit experiments show that the microwave fields above the trap are in excellent agreement with software simulations. There are good prospects for demonstrating a multi-qubit gate in the near future.

Although the elementary requirements for quantum computation have been demonstrated in this system, there exist theoretical and technical obstacles to scaling up the approach to large numbers of qubits. Therefore, recent efforts have been concentrated on using quantum communication to link a number of small ion-trap quantum systems. Developing the array-based approach, we show how to achieve massively parallel gate operation in a large-scale quantum computer, based on techniques already demonstrated for manipulating small quantum registers. The use of decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence during ion transport, and removes the requirement of clock synchronization between the interaction regions.},

	abstract = {A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized π/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Harnessing quantum mechanics to solve problems intractable on classical computers is one of the foremost goals of applied physics. Trapped ions make an excellent physical platform for such a quantum computer, as they have demonstrated unparalleled qubit operation fidelities and memory times, but significant challenges remain in scaling up these systems. A promising scalable architecture is a photonically connected network of mixed element trapped ion nodes, each containing a few ions of two species. Poor quality remote entanglement links between nodes can be tolerated, if entanglement between ions in the same node can be achieved with high fidelity. While local gates have been repeatedly demonstrated between ions of the same species, the fidelity of mixed element quantum gates have not previously surpassed the fault tolerant threshold, above which errors can in principle be corrected.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this thesis we demonstrate an entangling operation between $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$, useful for its long lived qubits, and $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$, well suited for remote entanglement, using a novel mechanism requiring only one laser to manipulate both species. This relatively simple scheme, which is independent of either qubit frequency, allows us to achieve Bell state fidelities of F = 99.8(1)\%. We assess the operation of the gate further with state and process tomography, which achieve Bell state fidelity F = 98.1\% and average gate fidelity F̅ = 99.05(6)\% respectively, though they are hampered by experimental drifts during the long data collection. Finally, we use interleaved randomised benchmarking to get the best estimate of our gate errors, finding an average gate fidelity of F̅ = 99.62(3)\% for a sequence of 60 interleaved gates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Along with a demonstration of entanglement between two $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$ ions, achieved with fidelity F = 95.9(4)\%, this work paves the way towards demonstrating an elementary mixed species quantum network in future experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The standard quantum limit can only be beaten by using N quantum correlated particles, with an improvement factor of √N. Here we report the demonstration of an entanglement-enhanced microscope, which is a confocal-type differential interference contrast microscope where an entangled photon pair (N=2) source is used for illumination. An image of a Q shape carved in relief on the glass surface is obtained with better visibility than with a classical light source.

Precision frequency comparisons between clocks in separate locations enable one to probe the space–time variation of fundamental constants4,5 and the properties of dark matter6,7, to perform geodesy8–10 and to evaluate systematic clock shifts. Measurements on independent systems are limited by the standard quantum limit; measurements on entangled systems can surpass the standard quantum limit to reach the ultimate precision allowed by quantum theory—the Heisenberg limit. Although local entangling operations have demonstrated this enhancement at microscopic distances11–16, comparisons between remote atomic clocks require the rapid generation of high-fidelity entanglement between systems that have no intrinsic interactions. Here we report the use of a photonic link17,18 to entangle two 88Sr+ ions separated by a macroscopic distance19 (approximately 2 m) to demonstrate an elementary quantum network of entangled optical clocks. For frequency comparisons between the ions, we find that entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by nearly \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{2\}\$\$, the value predicted for the Heisenberg limit. Today’s optical clocks are typically limited by dephasing of the probe laser20; in this regime, we find that entanglement yields a factor of 2 reduction in the measurement uncertainty compared with conventional correlation spectroscopy techniques20–22. We demonstrate this enhancement for the measurement of a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. This two-node network could be extended to additional nodes23, to other species of trapped particles or—through local operations—to larger entangled systems.},

Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations5–7 and single-qubit rotations8 so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams9–12 or by moving ions with respect to laser beams13–15, but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods16–20 may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of \$\$\{1\}\_\{-0.0017\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0\}\$\$and \$\$\{0.9977\}\_\{-0.0013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0010\}\$\$, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics21,22 and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout23,24 provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.},

In this paper, a new method of modelling the laser–ion interaction is introduced that turns out to be superior to standard techniques for the description of gate operations on optical qubits. The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on σz ⊗ σz and σφ ⊗ σφ interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser ﬁeld can be realized by an amplitudemodulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Trapped ions are a promising platform for experimental quantum computing, possessing the longest decoherence times and the highest fidelity logic gates of any candidate technology. The challenge remains to scale up ion-trap systems to larger numbers of qubits. This thesis benchmarks two fundamental operations for scalable trapped-ion quantum computing: the memory performance of a $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ hyperfine qubit, and mixed-element entangling gates between $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ and $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Decoherence is usually measured over long timescales, where the memory errors ε are large compared to state-preparation and measurement errors. Information about the small-error regime relevant for quantum computing is inferred by extrapolation. In this work we use randomised benchmarking to directly measure errors as small as 1.2(7) × 10$^{\textrm{−6}}$ after a storage time of 1 ms, which is around an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected based on the usual model of exponential decay. We find ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$ for up to 50 ms with no additional dynamical decoupling, and ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{−3}}$ for up to 2 seconds using a simple CPMG sequence. These timescales exceed previously-demonstrated gate or measurement times in trapped-ion systems by several orders of magnitude — a requirement for quantum error correction, and a highly desirable feature for near-term processors. The qubit is robust to offsets of the external magnetic-field strength, with ε$_{\textrm{m}}$ {\textless} 10$^{\textrm{-4}}$ for 1 ms even at a 50 mG offset, and we identify phase noise on the reference oscillator as the limiting factor on the memory performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We provide a comparison of different implementations of mixed-element geometric phase gates in the same experimental system. This includes a light-shift gate which can be implemented on both ion species using a single laser, with a fidelity of 99.8(1)\% or 99.7(1)\%, measured using partial state tomography or interleaved randomised benchmarking respectively. We also demonstrate several Mølmer–Sørensen gates with measured fidelities of up to 99.6(2)\% (by partial state tomography); this mechanism is more susceptible to errors arising from instability of the external magnetic field. For the first time, this pushes mixed-element entangling gate fidelities over the fault-tolerant threshold level (above which error correction is possible), and puts them on par with state-of-the-art single-species gates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The approach uses conventional components, materials and techniques in a unique fashion. The microtrap chip is mounted on a modified ceramic leadless chip carrier, the conductors of which serve as the vacuum feedthrough. The chip carrier is indium-sealed to stainless-steel components to form vacuum seals, resulting in short electrical path lengths of ≤20 mm from the trap electrodes under vacuum to air side. The feedthrough contains conductors for the radio-frequency trap drive, as well as 42 conductors for DC electrodes. Vacuum pressures of ∼1 × 10−11 mbar are achieved, and ions have been confined and laser cooled in a microtrap chip. The apparatus enables accurate measurements of radio-frequency voltage amplitudes on the trap electrodes, yielding an excellent agreement between measured and modelled trap efficiencies. This feature is of significant use in establishing initial operation of new devices. The principle of the connectivity scheme presented here is applicable to larger ceramic chip carriers containing many more conductors.},

All of the basic requirements for processing quantum information with arrays of ion-based quantum bits (qubits) have been proven in principle8. However, so far, no more than 14 ion-based qubits have been entangled with the ion-trap approach9, so there is a clear need for arrays of ion traps that can handle a much larger number of qubits10. Traps consisting of a two-dimensional electrode array11 have undergone significant development, but three-dimensional trap geometries can create a superior confining potential. However, existing three-dimensional approaches, as used in the most advanced experiments with trap arrays8,12, cannot be scaled up to handle greatly increased numbers of ions. Here, we report a monolithic three-dimensional ion microtrap array etched from a silica-on-silicon wafer using conventional semiconductor fabrication technology. We have confined individual 88Sr+ ions and strings of up to 14 ions in a single segment of the array. We have measured motional frequencies, ion heating rates and storage times. Our results demonstrate that it should be possible to handle several tens of ion-based qubits with this approach.},

Many self-organizing microrobotic collectives have been developed to overcome inherent limits in actuation, sensing, and manipulation of individual microrobots; however, reconfigurable collectives with robust transitions between behaviors are rare. Such systems that perform multiple functions are advantageous to operate in complex environments. Here, we present a versatile microrobotic collective system capable of on-demand reconfiguration to adapt to and utilize their environments to perform various functions at the air–water interface. Our system exhibits diverse modes ranging from isotropic to anisotrpic behaviors and transitions between a globally driven and a novel self-propelling behavior. We show the transition between different modes in experiments and simulations, and demonstrate various functions, using the reconfigurability of our system to navigate, explore, and interact with the environment. Such versatile microrobot collectives with globally driven and self-propelled behaviors have great potential in future medical and environmental applications.},

Yet, the most common methods for sideband cooling implicitly rely on low Doppler-cooled temperatures and tightly confined ions, and they cannot be optimized for different experimental conditions. Here we introduce a framework which calculates the fastest possible pulsed sideband cooling sequence for a given number of pulses and set of experimental parameters, and we verify its improvement compared to traditional methods using a trapped \${\textasciicircum}\{171\}\$Yb\${\textasciicircum}+\$ ion. After extensive cooling, we find that the ion motional distribution is distinctly non-thermal and thus not amenable to standard thermometry techniques. We therefore develop and experimentally validate an improved method to measure ion temperatures after sideband cooling. These techniques will enable more efficient cooling and thermometry within trapped-ion systems, especially those with high initial temperatures or spatially-extended ion wavepackets.},

	abstract = {Laser cooling of a single trapped ion with Zeeman substructure below the Doppler limit is considered theoretically. The laser field consists of two counterpropagating beams linearly polarized in different directions, and the internal atomic transition is Jg=1/2→Je=3/2. The ion is assumed to be localized to spatial dimensions smaller than the optical wavelength (Lamb-Dicke limit) and placed at a specific position with respect to the laser beams. Under the assumption that the rate for optical pumping between the atomic ground states defines the smallest time constant in the system, analytic expressions for the final energy and the cooling rates are derived, with both a semiclassical and a full quantum treatment. The results show that laser cooling of a trapped ion using polarization gradients leads to very low energies. These energies are insensitive to the precise localization of the ion with respect to the lasers, the angle between the direction of the polarizations of the laser beams, and the detuning of the cooling laser.},

	abstract = {Laser cooling of trapped ions in a standing- and running-wave configuration is discussed theoretically. The ions are assumed to be spatially localized on the scale provided by the wavelength of the laser (Lamb-Dicke limit). A master equation for the center-of-mass distribution of the ion is derived for a multilevel system, and explicit results are presented for two- and three-level systems and harmonic trapping potentials. For the two-level system located at the node of the standing wave, we find final temperatures that are a factor of 2 lower than the limit for a running wave and cooling rates that do not saturate with the laser intensity. At the point of maximum gradient of the standing wave, blue detuned cooling is found that is analogous to the Sisyphus cooling of free atoms. For a three-level system we compare our results with those of Wineland, Dalibard, and Cohen-Tannoudji [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 9, 32 (1992)].},

The technique can be applied to systems with at least three non-degenerate energy levels which can be coupled to a linear quantum harmonic oscillator, such as in trapped ion experiments. The method relies on probing an Autler-Townes splitting that arises when two levels are strongly coupled via a phonon-number changing transition. We demonstrate the method using a single trapped ion and show that it may be used in a non-demolition fashion to prepare phonon number states. We also show how the Autler-Townes splitting can be used to measure phonon number distributions.},

	abstract = {For fault tolerant quantum computing it is necessary to perform a series of quantum gates on a register of qubits in a short period of time. In the case of an ion trap quantum computer these gates are implemented by shining laser beams onto the ions in a controlled way. This thesis deals with the development and implementation of a novel setup for single ion addressing, which enables simultaneous and individual manipulation of the ions. The new setup makes use of ﬁbre beamsplitters for multiplexing the addressing laser and ﬁbre AOMs for altering each beam individually. A micro-mirror array is utilised to point each beam to a single ion. The optics needed to focus the beams onto individual ions is simulated and investigated in a test setup. The most promising of the simulated setups, which is expected to be able to address up to four ions, is implemented into the experiment. The waist of the central addressing beam in this setup is measured to be w0 = 1.52(5) µm. For future experiments, simulations with another objective with NA {\textasciitilde} 0.8 are performed, which indicate addressability of up to 19 ions.},

	abstract = {The ability to individually and agilely manipulate qubits is crucial for the scalable trapped-ion quantum information processing. A plethora of challenging proposals have been demonstrated with the utilization of optical addressing systems, in which single ions is addressed exclusively by individual laser beam. However, crosstalk error in optical addressing systems limits the gate fidelity, becoming an obstacle to quantum computing, especially quantum error correction. In this work, we demonstrate a low-crosstalk double-side addressing system based on a pair of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). The AODs addressing method can flexibly and parallelly address arbitrary ions between which the distance is variable in a chain. We employ two 0.4{\textasciitilde}NA objective lenses in both arms of the Raman laser and obtain a beam waist of 0.95{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$, resulting in a Rabi rate crosstalk as low as \$6.32{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ when the neighboring ion separation is about 5.5{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$. This agile and low-crosstalk double-side addressing system is promising for higher-fidelity gates and the practical application of the quantum error correction.},

The AOD is designed as a beam scanner to address two-photon transitions in a two-dimensional array of trapped neutral Rb87 atoms in a quantum computer. Momentum space is used to design AODs that have the same diffraction angles for two wavelengths (780 and 480 nm) and have nonoverlapping Bragg-matched frequency response at these wavelengths, so that there will be no cross talk when proportional frequencies are applied to diffract the two wavelengths. The appropriate crystal orientation, crystal shape, transducer size, and transducer height are determined for an AOD made with a tellurium dioxide crystal (TeO2). The designed and fabricated AOD has more than 100 resolvable spots, widely separated band shapes for the two wavelengths within an overall octave bandwidth, spatially overlapping diffraction angles for both wavelengths (780 and 480 nm), and a 4 μs or less access time. Cascaded AODs in which the first device upshifts and the second downshifts allow Doppler-free scanning as required for addressing the narrow atomic resonance without detuning. We experimentally show the diffraction-limited Doppler-free scanning performance and spatial resolution of the designed AOD.},

A number of models of quantum computation exist. These models have been shown to be formally equivalent, but their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. A particularly exciting paradigm is that of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state. We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization. Finally, we highlight a number of connections between this field and other branches of physics and mathematics.},

The choice of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer (1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared to the gate array model, especially issues of parallelisability of algorithms.},

The ﬁeld of quantum error correction has developed to meet this challenge. A group-theoretical structure and associated subclass of quantum codes, the stabilizer codes, has proved particularly fruitful in producing codes and in understanding the structure of both speciﬁc codes and classes of codes. I will give an overview of the ﬁeld of quantum error correction and the formalism of stabilizer codes. In the context of stabilizer codes, I will discuss a number of known codes, the capacity of a quantum channel, bounds on quantum codes, and fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

The problem of stable trapping of general three-dimensional crystals is considered and the validity of the pseudopotential approximation is discussed. We analytically derive the micromotion amplitude of the ions, rigorously proving well-known experimental observations. We use a recently proposed method to find the modes that diagonalize the linearized time-dependent dynamical problem. This allows one to obtain explicitly the (‘Floquet–Lyapunov’) transformation to coordinates of decoupled linear oscillators. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analyzing the modes of a small ‘peculiar’ crystal in a linear Paul trap. The calculations can be readily generalized to multispecies ion crystals in general multipole traps, and time-dependent quantum wavefunctions of ion oscillations in such traps can be obtained.},

	abstract = {In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n{\textasciitilde}200.},

	abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

Regardless of the method used, most pickers struggle when ice thickness varies on a micrograph. IceBreaker allows users to estimate the relative ice gradient and flatten it by equalizing the local contrast. It allows the differentiation of particles from the background and improves overall particle picking performance. Furthermore, we introduce an additional parameter corresponding to local ice thickness for each particle. Particles with a defined ice thickness can be grouped and filtered based on this parameter during processing. These functionalities are especially valuable for on-the-fly processing to automatically pick as many particles as possible from each micrograph and to select optimal regions for data collection. Finally, estimated ice gradient distributions can be stored separately and used to inspect the quality of prepared samples.},

Trapped ion qubits are one of the leading candidates for implementing a quantum computer, having previously demonstrated all of the required criteria. Local gate fidelities between ions exceed those for all other platforms, but the total number of ions in a trap is limited by unavoidable issues – one possibility for scaling the ion trap quantum processor is to create entanglement between ions in separate traps via single photons. The work in this thesis demonstrates the generation of remote entanglement between ions at high fidelity and rate, paving the way towards protocols using multiple entangled pairs for computations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We describe the construction from scratch of a twin-trap apparatus designed to entangle separated ions. We demonstrate the entanglement of strontium ions in traps separated by ∼ 2 m by swapping entanglement from single photons emitted by the $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$ ions. A novel photon collection geometry is used, maximising the entanglement between the ion and photon without impeding optical access for standard ion trap laser beam geometries. The Bell state fidelity of the ion-photon state, which is itself a valuable entanglement resource for blind computation, is at least 97.70(12) \% in either trap, with entangled pairs detected at a rate of at least 3.98 × 10$^{\textrm{3}}$ s$^{\textrm{−1}}$. The remote ion-ion Bell state fidelity is 94.0(5) \%, and is generated at a rate of 182 s$^{\textrm{−1}}$, representing the highest fidelity remote entanglement reported in ions by a large margin, at a rate more than an order of magnitude faster than previous experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The two identical trap systems are designed with capabilities beyond those demonstrated here. We can co-trap $^{\textrm{88}}$Sr$^{\textrm{+}}$ and $^{\textrm{43}}$Ca$^{\textrm{+}}$ in a microfabricated trap suitable for local ion transport operations, opening up the possibility of performing distillation of remote entanglement in the same apparatus. Entanglement distillation can be used to make remote entanglement with similar fidelity to local operations, and would represent a significant step towards a fully scalable ion trap quantum computer architecture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Their excitations can be represented by bosons such as photons, single particles of light, or phonons, the quanta of vibrational energy. Linear interactions that only create and annihilate single bosons can generate coherent states of light or motion. Introducing nth-order nonlinear interactions, that instead involve n bosons, leads to increasingly complex quantum behaviour. For example, second-order interactions enable squeezing, used to enhance the precision of measurements beyond classical limits, while higher-order interactions create non-Gaussian states essential for continuous-variable quantum computation. However, generating nonlinear interactions is challenging, typically requiring higher-order derivatives of the driving field or specialized hardware. Hybrid systems, where linear interactions couple an oscillator to an additional spin, offer a solution and are readily available across many platforms. Here, using the spin of a single trapped ion coupled to its motion, we employ two linear interactions to demonstrate up to fourth-order bosonic interactions; we focus on generalised squeezing interactions and demonstrate squeezing, trisqueezing, and quadsqueezing. We characterise these interactions, including their spin dependence, and reconstruct the Wigner function of the resulting states. We also discuss the scaling of the interaction strength, where we drive the quadsqueezing interaction more than 100 times faster than using conventional techniques. Our method presents no fundamental limit in the interaction order n and applies to any platform supporting spin-dependent linear interactions. Strong higher-order nonlinear interactions unlock the study of fundamental quantum optics, quantum simulation, and computation in a hitherto unexplored regime.},

	abstract = {Scalable trapped-ion quantum computation relies on the development of highfidelity fast entangling gates in many-ion crystals. The speed of travelling wave Mølmer-Sørensen entangling gates is limited by off-resonant carrier excitations which do not commute with the neccessary sideband excitations. Standing waves formed by counter-propogating beams offer a potential pathway to achieve fast entanglement by suppressing undesired carrier excitations. We present initial results of this carrier suppression in the 674-nm quadropole transition of 88Sr+. We demonstrate fast two-qubit entangling gates which exceed the entangling “speed limit” imposed by non-commuting off-resonant carrier excitations. To explore entangling operations at durations comparable to the secular trap frequency, we require high light intensity at the ions. A new system is being constructed featuring standing wave single ion addressing to generate these high intensities. It will also utilize a microfabricated, segmented 3D Paul trap for greater control of long ion chains. We will work with 40Ca+ which has a quadrupole transition at 729-nm. We present the current progress and roadmap of this next-generation platform and motivations behind the design choices.},

However, existing analytic expression for the steady state phonon occupation of EIT cooling is limited to the zeroth order of the Lamb-Dicke parameter.

We observe the emergence of phononic bright and dark states for both a single phonon and a superposition of coherent states and demonstrate that a view of interference which is based solely on their decomposition in the collective basis is able to intuitively describe their coupling to a single atom. This work also marks the first time that multi-mode bright and dark states have been formed with the bounded motion of a single trapped ion and we highlight the potential of the methods discussed here for use in quantum information processing.},

We present measurements of this effect by performing individually-addressed entangling gates in chains of up to 25 trapped atomic ions that are weakly confined along the chain axis. We present a model that accurately describes the observed decoherence from the residual heating of the ions caused by noisy electric fields.

	abstract = {Laser-controlled entanglement between atomic qubits (‘spins’) and collective motion in trapped ion Coulomb crystals requires conditional momentum transfer from the laser. Since the spin-dependent force is derived from a spatial gradient in the spin-light interaction, this force is typically longitudinal — parallel and proportional to the average laser k-vector (or two beams’ k-vector diﬀerence), which constrains both the direction and relative magnitude of the accessible spinmotion coupling. Here, we show how momentum can also be transferred perpendicular to a single laser beam due to the gradient in its transverse proﬁle. By controlling the transverse gradient at the position of the ion through beam shaping, the relative strength of the sidebands and carrier can be tuned to optimize the desired interaction and suppress undesired, oﬀ-resonant eﬀects that can degrade gate ﬁdelity. We also discuss how this eﬀect may already be playing an unappreciated role in recent experiments.},

In order to optimally observe the specific effects, focusing the angular momentum beam close to the diffraction limit is required. We discuss a protocol for examining experimentally the effects on the S1/2 to D5/2 transition using a 40Ca+ ion. Various applications and advantages are expected when using light carrying angular momentum: in quantum information processing, where qubit states of ion crystals are controlled, parasitic light shifts could be avoided as the ion is excited in the dark zone of the beam at zero electric field amplitude. Such interactions also open the door to high dimensional entanglement between light and matter. In spectroscopy one might access transitions which have escaped excitation so far due to vanishing transition dipole moments.},

However, generating high-fidelity gates, in a scalable manner, remains a major challenge in all quantum information processing platforms. Accordingly, improving the fidelity and robustness of these gates has been a research focus in recent years. In trapped ions quantum computers, entangling gates are performed by driving the normal modes of motion of the ion chain, generating a spin-dependent force. Even though there has been significant progress in increasing the robustness and modularity of these gates, they are still sensitive to noise in the intensity of the driving field. Here we supplement the conventional spin-dependent displacement with spin-dependent squeezing, which creates a new interaction, that enables a gate that is robust to deviations in the amplitude of the driving field. We solve the general Hamiltonian and engineer its spectrum analytically. We also endow our gate with other, more conventional, robustness properties, making it resilient to many practical sources of noise and inaccuracies.},

Quantized excitations of vibrational modes (phonons) of trapped ions are a promising candidate to realize such bosonic networks. Here, we demonstrate a minimal-loss programmable phononic network in which any phononic state can be deterministically prepared and detected. We realize networks with up to four collective vibrational modes, which can be extended to reveal quantum advantage. We benchmark the performance of the network for an exemplary tomography algorithm using arbitrary multi-mode states with fixed total phonon number.

For resonant periodic driving at the on-site interaction strength and an appropriate choice of the modulation parameters, the effective Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits \$\$\{{\textbackslash}Bbb Z\}\_2\$\$symmetry. We study the dynamics of the system for different initial states and critically contrast the observed evolution with a theoretical analysis of the full time-dependent Hamiltonian of the periodically driven lattice model. We reveal challenges that arise due to symmetry-breaking terms and outline potential pathways to overcome these limitations. Our results provide important insights for future studies of lattice gauge theories based on Floquet techniques.},

	abstract = {Particle physics underpins our understanding of the world at a fundamental level by describing the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories. Yet, despite their unmatched success, the intrinsic quantum mechanical nature of gauge theories makes important problem classes notoriously difficult to address with classical computational techniques. A promising way to overcome these roadblocks is offered by quantum computers, which are based on the same laws that make the classical computations so difficult. Here, we present a quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields and matter. This computation is made possible by the use of a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in \$d\$ different states per ion, rather than in two states as in qubits. Qudits are ideally suited for describing gauge fields, which are naturally high-dimensional, leading to a dramatic reduction in the quantum register size and circuit complexity. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we find the ground state of the model and observe the interplay between virtual pair creation and quantized magnetic field effects. The qudit approach further allows us to seamlessly observe the effect of different gauge field truncations by controlling the qudit dimension. Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations with qudits in near-term quantum devices.},

We introduce a versatile toolbox based on parametric excitations corresponding to different spin-motion-coupling schemes that induce a tunneling of the ions vibrational excitations conditioned to their internal qubit state. This building block, when implemented with a single trapped ion, corresponds to a minimal Z2 gauge theory, where the qubit plays the role of the gauge field on a synthetic link, and the vibrational excitations along different trap axes mimic the dynamical matter fields two synthetic sites, each carrying a Z2 charge. To evaluate their feasibility, we perform numerical simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to generalise this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number of ions, moving from a single link to a Z2 plaquette, and to an entire Z2 chain. We present analytical expressions for the gauge-invariant dynamics and the corresponding confinement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state simulations.},

The lack of nonlinearity in photonics has led to encoded measurement-based quantum computing, which relies on linear operations but requires access to resourceful (’nonlinear’) quantum states, such as cubic phase states. In contrast, superconducting microwave circuits offer engineerable nonlinearities but suffer from static Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate universal control of a bosonic mode composed of a superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) resonator, enabled by native nonlinearities in the SNAIL element. We suppress static nonlinearities by operating the SNAIL in the vicinity of its Kerr-free point and dynamically activate nonlinearities up to third order by fast flux pulses. We experimentally realize a universal set of generalized squeezing operations, as well as the cubic phase gate, and exploit them to deterministically prepare a cubic phase state in 60 ns. Our results initiate the experimental field of polynomial quantum computing, in the continuous-variables notion originally introduced by Lloyd and Braunstein.},

Additionally, two faster gates were demonstrated without the use of dynamical decoupling.

	abstract = {The viability of quantum computers depends on the development of scalable platforms with low error rates. Our ”Oregon Ions” group has studied one such scalable architecture proposal including the limitations placed on logic gate fidelity by photon scattering. We studied spontaneous Raman scattering-induced errors in stimulated Raman laser beam-driven logic gates in metastable- and ground-manifold-encoded qubits. For certain parameter regimes, we found that previous, simplified models of the process significantly overestimated the gate error rate due to spontaneous photon scattering. We developed an improved model, which shows that there is no fundamental lower limit on gate error due to spontaneous photon scattering for electronic ground state qubits in commonly-used trapped-ion species when the Raman laser beams are red detuned from the main optical transition. Additionally, spontaneous photon scattering errors are studied for qubits encoded in a metastable D5/2 manifold, showing that gate errors below 10−4 are achievable for all commonly used trapped ions. Furthermore, we extended this theory from hyperfine to Zeeman qubits and we measured scattering rates from far-detuned Raman beams in a metastable D5/2 Zeeman qubits in 40Ca+, obtaining results that matched theoretical expectations. Finally, we present progress towards implementing a two-qubit Mølmer-Sørensen gate with these Raman beams in trapped 40Ca+ ions.

Characterizing noise processes via their power spectral density is routinely done throughout science and technology and can be a demanding task. Determining the phase noise power spectrum in leading quantum technology platforms, for example, can be either outside the reach of many phase noise analyzers or prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present and characterize a low-complexity, low-cost optical phase noise analyzer based on the short-delay optical self-heterodyne measurements for quantum technology applications. Using this setup, we compare two ≈1 Hz linewidth ultra-stable oscillators near 729 nm. Their measurements are used as a baseline to determine and discuss the noise floor achieved in this measurement apparatus with a focus on limitations and their tradeoffs. The achieved noise floor in this all-stock-component implementation of an optical phase noise analyzer compares favorably with commercial offerings.

The required building blocks have all been demonstrated with high fidelity, recently culminating in elementary demonstrations of quantum error correction. The main challenge now is to scale up current-day systems without increasing the errors, but reducing them instead.  The first part of this thesis is concerned with technical challenges faced when scaling up trapped-ion systems. We therefore present the design of a cryogenic ion trap setup and use it to evaluate new technological approaches. We perform a detailed characterization of the apparatus to identify its main limiting factors and to uncover unknown unknowns.  The second part of this thesis is concerned with the use of feedback control, primarily for laser stabilization. We explore its benefits but also associated challenges and fundamental limitations in a number of scenarios motivated by the experimental apparatus and its characterization. A common theme in the latter is the occurrence of noise at discrete frequencies or confined to narrow frequency bands. We therefore investigate how to tailor feedback control loops to be particularly effective at these frequencies by incorporating resonant elements into the controller.  The presentation in the second part is kept general enough such that it can serve as a reference on feedback control for a broad audience within atomic, molecular and optical physics. The goal is to provide a map of the control engineering literature to help physicists navigate the landscape, ultimately leading to better experiments.},

	abstract = {We present an experiment investigating the rotational Doppler effect using a single trapped ion excited by two copropagating vortex laser beams. The setup isolates the azimuthal gradients of the fields, eliminating longitudinal and curvature effects. We provide a detailed characterization of the phenomenon by deterministically positioning a single ion across the beams, achieving a signal which depends on the angular velocity of the ion and the difference of optical orbital angular momentum between the two beams. The interpretation of the measurements is supported by numerical simulations and by a simplified analytical model. Our results reveal key properties of the rotational Doppler effect, showing that it increases approaching the center of the beam and that it is independent of the waist of the beam. This offers insights into the feasibility of super-kicks or super-Doppler shifts for sensing and manipulating atomic motion transverse to the beams' propagation direction.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.},

Additionally, using the internal-state dependence of the interaction, we perform a direct measurement of the energy distribution of the motion of a single ion using carrier spectroscopy.

Recent work showed that a regime of 'strong coupling' can be obtained, where a single photon is absorbed and re-emitted many times. Schuster et al. have built a special type of cavity QED system that is embedded within an electronic circuit; in it a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) interacts with photons from a microwave transmission line. A novel regime can be produced in this system, namely the strong dispersive limit, where a single photon has a large effect on the qubit without being absorbed. This opens the possibility of nondestructive counting of photons that are present in the cavity. This effect could be used as a basis for qubit–photon conditional logic, a requirement for quantum computing.},

This connection suggests an expansion of the characteristic function in terms of Feynman diagrams, exposing the role of the real-time bosonic propagator, and identifying the external source functions with certain time-dependent couplings that can be controlled experimentally. By applying maximum-likelihood techniques, we show that the ``measurement'' of these Feynman diagrams can be reformulated as a problem of multi-parameter point estimation that takes as input a set of Ramsey-type measurements of the qubit. By numerical simulations that consider leading imperfections in trapped-ion devices, we identify the optimal regimes in which Feynman diagrams could be reconstructed from measured data with low systematic and stochastic errors. We discuss how these ideas can be generalized to finite temperatures via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, contributing to a bottom-up approach to probe quantum simulators of lattice field theories by systematically increasing the qubit-oscillator number.},

To identify a ‘quantum advantage’ for these simulations, performance analysis of both analog-quantum simulation on noisy hardware and classical-digital algorithms is needed. In this Review, we make a comparison between a noisy analog trapped-ion simulator and a few choice classical-digital methods on simulating the dynamics of a model molecular Hamiltonian with linear vibronic coupling. We describe several simple Hamiltonians that are commonly used to model molecular systems, which can be simulated with existing or emerging trapped-ion hardware. These Hamiltonians may serve as stepping stones towards the use of trapped-ion simulators for systems beyond the reach of classical-digital methods. Finally, we identify dynamical regimes in which classical-digital simulations seem to have the weakest performance with respect to analog-quantum simulations. These regimes may provide the lowest hanging fruit to make the most of potential quantum advantages.},

This convenient abstraction mirrors classical computations manipulating finite sets of symbols, and allows for a device-independent development of algorithmic primitives. Here we advocate an alternative approach centered on the physical setup and the associated set of natively available operations. We show that these can be leveraged to great benefit by sidestepping the standard approach of reasoning about computation in terms of individual qubits. As an example, we consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with linear optics operations augmented by certain qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. The continuous-variable (CV) Fourier transform has a native realization in such systems in the form of homodyne momentum measurements. We show that this fact can be put to algorithmic use. Specifically, we give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm in this setup which finds a factor of an \$n\$-bit integer \$N\$. Unlike Shor's algorithm, or CV implementations thereof based on qubit-to-oscillator encodings, our algorithm relies on the CV (rather than discrete) Fourier transform. The physical system used is independent of the number \$N\$ to be factored: It consists of a single qubit and three oscillators only.},

Here, we create arbitrary superpositions of nonclassical and non-Gaussian states of a quantum harmonic oscillator using the motion of a trapped ion coupled to its internal spin states. We interleave spin-dependent nonlinear bosonic interactions and mid-circuit measurements of the spin that preserve the coherence of the oscillator. These techniques enable the creation of superpositions between squeezed, trisqueezed, and quadsqueezed states, which have never been demonstrated before, with independent control over the complex-valued squeezing parameter and the probability amplitude of each constituent, as well as their spatial separation. We directly observe the nonclassical nature of these states in the form of Wigner negativity following a full state reconstruction.

	abstract = {The realisation of a universal quantum computer at scale promises to deliver a paradigm shift in information processing, providing the capability to solve problems that are intractable with conventional computers. A key limiting factor of realising fault-tolerant quantum information processing (QIP) is the large ratio of physical-to-logical qubits that outstrip device sizes available in the near future. An alternative approach proposed by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP) encodes a single logical qubit into a single harmonic oscillator, alleviating this hardware overhead in exchange for a more complex encoding. Owing to this complexity, current experiments with GKP codes have been limited to single-qubit encodings and operations. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of a universal gate set for the GKP code, which includes single-qubit gates and -- for the first time -- a two-qubit entangling gate between logical code words. Our scheme deterministically implements energy-preserving quantum gates on finite-energy GKP states encoded in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion. This is achieved by a novel optimal control strategy that dynamically modulates an interaction between the ion's spin and motion. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with a logical process fidelity as high as 0.960 and a two-qubit entangling gate with a logical process fidelity of 0.680. We also directly create a GKP Bell state from the oscillators' ground states in a single step with a logical state fidelity of 0.842. The overall scheme is compatible with existing hardware architectures, highlighting the opportunity to leverage optimal control strategies as a key accelerant towards fault tolerance.},

	abstract = {The stable operation of quantum computers will rely on error correction, in which single quantum bits of information are stored redundantly in the Hilbert space of a larger system. Such encoded qubits are commonly based on arrays of many physical qubits, but can also be realized using a single higher-dimensional quantum system, such as a harmonic oscillator1–3. In such a system, a powerful encoding has been devised based on periodically spaced superpositions of position eigenstates4–6. Various proposals have been made for realizing approximations to such states, but these have thus far remained out of reach7–11. Here we demonstrate such an encoded qubit using a superposition of displaced squeezed states of the harmonic motion of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion, controlling and measuring the mechanical oscillator through coupling to an ancillary internal-state qubit12. We prepare and reconstruct logical states with an average squared fidelity of 87.3 ± 0.7 per cent. Also, we demonstrate a universal logical single-qubit gate set, which we analyse using process tomography. For Pauli gates we reach process fidelities of about 97 per cent, whereas for continuous rotations we use gate teleportation and achieve fidelities of approximately 89 per cent. This control method opens a route for exploring continuous variable error correction as well as hybrid quantum information schemes using both discrete and continuous variables13. The code states also have direct applications in quantum sensing, allowing simultaneous measurement of small displacements in both position and momentum14,15.},

Although error-correcting codes implemented using individual physical qubits require many separate systems to be controlled, codes constructed using a quantum oscillator offer the possibility to perform error correction with a single physical entity. One powerful encoding approach for oscillators is the grid state or Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) encoding, which allows small displacement errors to be corrected. Here we introduce and implement a dissipative map designed for physically realistic finite GKP codes, which performs quantum error correction of a logical qubit encoded in the motion of a single trapped ion. The correction cycle involves two rounds, which correct small displacements in position and momentum. We demonstrate an extension in coherence time of logical states by a factor of three using both square and hexagonal GKP codes. The simple dissipative map used for this correction can be viewed as a type of reservoir engineering, which pumps into the manifold of highly non-classical GKP qubit states.},

	abstract = {The encoding and manipulation of information using the quantum states of trapped ions currently represents one of the most promising routes towards the realisation of a universal quantum computer. Although quantum gates in this system were originally driven by lasers, an alternative approach that uses the magnetic field gradients generated by current-carrying structures integrated directly into the trap has gained traction in recent years. This laser-free approach offers a few advantages, but the implementation of fast two-qubit gates with fidelities below the threshold required for quantum error correction remains challenging. In this thesis I describe progress in an ion trap system aimed at improving the fidelity and speed of two-qubit gates driven by magnetic field gradients oscillating near the transition frequency of the qubit. Work is based on a hyperfine qubit in 43Ca+ that has not been used for quantum logic before. We operate at a static magnetic field of 28.8 mT, at which point the qubit frequency of approximately 3.1 GHz becomes to first order insensitive to field fluctuations, enabling an internal coherence time that is orders of magnitude larger than the duration of quantum gates. The strong magnetic field results in a complex energy level structure, with adjacent states in the ground level being split by several multiples of the linewidths of the cooling lasers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate cooling to a temperature of 0.5mK for a single ion, close to the Doppler limit, by exploiting dark resonances that form between fine-structure levels. Furthermore, we implement resolved-sideband cooling using two laser beams driving a Raman transition, achieving an average occupation number ¯n = 0.08 for the two-ion motional mode of interest. Experiments are carried out in a surface trap that is suitable for operation at room and cryogenic temperatures. It features a U-shaped microwave electrode, which produces a microwave magnetic field such that the field component coupling the qubit states exhibits a strong gradient, but significantly reduced amplitude around the trap centre. I discuss measurements of parameters that will impact twoqubit gate fidelity, such as heating rates, drifts in motional frequencies, ac Zeeman shifts and the spatial dependence of the microwave magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate spin-motion entanglement for a single ion using the Mølmer-Sørensen scheme and present the results of initial attempts at a twoqubit gate, for which we measure a fidelity of 0.77(2). I also provide a brief analysis of dominant sources of error that will have to be addressed in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Universal logic gates for two quantum bits (qubits) form an essential ingredient of quantum computation. Dynamical gates have been proposed1,2 in the context of trapped ions; however, geometric phase gates (which change only the phase of the physical qubits) offer potential practical advantages because they have higher intrinsic resistance to certain small errors and might enable faster gate implementation. Here we demonstrate a universal geometric π-phase gate between two beryllium ion-qubits, based on coherent displacements induced by an optical dipole force. The displacements depend on the internal atomic states; the motional state of the ions is unimportant provided that they remain in the regime in which the force can be considered constant over the extent of each ion's wave packet. By combining the gate with single-qubit rotations, we have prepared ions in an entangled Bell state with 97\% fidelity—about six times better than in a previous experiment3 demonstrating a universal gate between two ion-qubits. The particular properties of the gate make it attractive for a multiplexed trap architecture4,5 that would enable scaling to large numbers of ion-qubits.},

	abstract = {Local realism is the idea that objects have definite properties whether or not they are measured, and that measurements of these properties are not affected by events taking place sufficiently far away1. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen2 used these reasonable assumptions to conclude that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Starting in 1965, Bell and others constructed mathematical inequalities whereby experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories1,3,4,5. Many experiments1,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism. But these conclusions remain the subject of considerable interest and debate, and experiments are still being refined to overcome ‘loopholes’ that might allow a local realistic interpretation. Here we have measured correlations in the classical properties of massive entangled particles (9Be+ ions): these correlations violate a form of Bell's inequality. Our measured value of the appropriate Bell's ‘signal’ is 2.25 ± 0.03, whereas a value of 2 is the maximum allowed by local realistic theories of nature. In contrast to previous measurements with massive particles, this violation of Bell's inequality was obtained by use of a complete set of measurements. Moreover, the high detection efficiency of our apparatus eliminates the so-called ‘detection’ loophole.},

On a small scale, they have shown the longest qubit coherence times [1] and the highest single- and two-qubit gate fidelities [2–5]. The challenge is finding ways to scale up the system while maintaining this level of performance to build usefully powerful quantum computers. In this thesis, we describe experimentally validated techniques to overcome some of the difficulties in scaling trapped-ion quantum computers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We use the vast state space available within a single ion to encode qubits both in the ground level and the metastable level [6]. This architecture enables measurement, cooling, and reset of the ground-level qubits while protecting the state of the metastable level ones. We demonstrate the building blocks of this architecture using trapped 137Ba+ ions. We implement a metastable level clock qubit in 137Ba+ and measure a coherence time of 31(5)s. We show that the coherence time of this clock qubit in the presence of the laser light for cooling and measurement is 21.9(21)s. We further demonstrate a two-qubit entangling gate between two metastable level qubits necessary for building a universal gate set. Moreover, we perform an entangling gate between a ground-level qubit and a metastable level qubit, the equivalent of the mixed-species gate [7]. This gate facilitates the implementation of quantum non-demolition measurements (QNDs) in our architecture directly without having to redefine the qubit encoding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Additionally, we present a new state preparation and measurement (SPAM) protocol that uses the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements to detect errors that occur during SPAM effectively. These errors can then be removed using post-selection or converted into erasures, one of the most straightforward errors to correct. We demonstrate the use of the protocol for three different qubit encodings in 137Ba+ : an optical qubit (O), a metastable level qubit (M), and a ground level qubit (G). For all three qubit types, we achieved the lowest reported SPAM infidelities of any qubit of O: 7(4) × 10−6, M: 5(4) × 10−6, and G: 8(4) × 10−6. The combination of these techniques can be used in building large-scale quantum computers based on trapped ions in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This convenient abstraction mirrors classical computations manipulating finite sets of symbols, and allows for a device-independent development of algorithmic primitives. Here we advocate an alternative approach centered on the physical setup and the associated set of natively available operations. We show that these can be leveraged to great benefit by sidestepping the standard approach of reasoning about computation in terms of individual qubits. As an example, we consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with linear optics operations augmented by certain qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. The continuous-variable (CV) Fourier transform has a native realization in such systems in the form of homodyne momentum measurements. We show that this fact can be put to algorithmic use. Specifically, we give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm in this setup which finds a factor of an \$n\$-bit integer \$N\$. Unlike Shor's algorithm, or CV implementations thereof based on qubit-to-oscillator encodings, our algorithm relies on the CV (rather than discrete) Fourier transform. The physical system used is independent of the number \$N\$ to be factored: It consists of a single qubit and three oscillators only.},

	abstract = {A quantum computer can be implemented with cold ions confined in a linear trap and interacting with laser beams. Quantum gates involving any pair, triplet, or subset of ions can be realized by coupling the ions through the collective quantized motion. In this system decoherence is negligible, and the measurement (readout of the quantum register) can be carried out with a high efficiency.},

	abstract = {To harness the potential of a quantum computer, quantum information must be protected against error by encoding it into a logical state that is suitable for quantum error correction. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit is a promising candidate because the required multiqubit operations are readily available at optical frequency. To date, however, GKP qubits have been demonstrated only at mechanical and microwave frequencies. We realized a GKP state in propagating light at telecommunication wavelength and verified it through homodyne measurements without loss corrections. The generation is based on interference of cat states, followed by homodyne measurements. Our final states exhibit nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity, including the trident shape of faint instances of GKP states. Improvements toward brighter, multipeaked GKP qubits will be the basis for quantum computation with light.},

	abstract = {This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing a universal quantum computer over continuous variables. As an example, it is shown how a universal quantum computer for the amplitudes of the electromagnetic field might be constructed using simple linear devices such as beam splitters and phase shifters, together with squeezers and nonlinear devices such as Kerr-effect fibers and atoms in optical cavities. Such a device could in principle perform “quantum floating point” computations. Problems involving noise, finite precision, and error correction are discussed.},
